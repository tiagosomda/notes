# She's Here! Introducing Valentina!

With hearts overflowing with joy and love, we are thrilled to announce the arrival of our precious daughter, Valentina!

- **Weight**: 6 lbs 7 oz
- **Length**: 19 inches

## A New Chapter Begins

Today marks the beginning of what I think will be the most rewarding adventure of our lives. Our family has grown by two tiny feet, ten perfect fingers, and one huge heart that has already captured ours completely.

Valentina arrived as planned and has already shown us her some of personality and demanding attitude.


## Dad is overjoyed
I am a dad now!  
-- dad


## Mom is recovering
- so in love that the painkillers are not that needed
- labor and delivery were great, but we had some very rough hours after delivery


## What's Next
For now, we're soaking in these precious early moments, learning this new rythm of life, and looking forward to decoding V's language.
