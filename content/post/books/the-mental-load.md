# Why did I read this book?
- to learn more about how I can be a better man.  

After I got married, I have been working, daily, to be the best husband that I can be.  
My wife deserves that and it is an awesome objective to strive for.  

My wife and I have agreed that we want to be equals in our relationship.  
Reading this book and reflecting on it, is one of my actions to understand a bit more about what are the struggles of being a woman.  
This book does it really well.


# Chapter 1: You should have asked
This is about how we need to make things more equal between genders.
There shouldn't be things that one gender is responsible for and the other(s) is(are) not.

Start by dividing up the recurrent tasks/chores equally.

I am not sure yet how useful this is, but if you think of something you need to do. Add it to your to-do list and set a date for when you will do it. Hop fully that can help you drive those things out of your mental load.

# 2. Violence of the oppressed

This chapter is about how fingers are pointed at the people being oppressed instead of the oppressors when the oppressed expressed violence.

Some friends have told me how they have to really watch out how they dress and act so that they can fit in an environment - this is added mental load that is unfair.

For example blacks need to dress well, drive nice cars, act calmly, speak well so that they are not victims of police brutality.

Another example is women at work (in tech, but I am sure in other places too), they can't act angry or express their opinions in am angry way. The men in those environments see those behaviors as unfit for a women, when in the other hand it is completely okay for aen to act like that.

# 2. Episiotomy in childbirth

Not needed but yet still used

As a men (or a partner to the one giving childbirth), we should read and inform ourselves just as much as the person giving birth and back them up on their decisions.

# 3. The Male Gaze

This chapter is about how society views women.

Over many many years, we (society) have objectified women. In our movies, games, advertisements, books, posters and so on.

It has become so ingrained within us that a lot of times, we have behaviors that keep on enforcing this objectification of women.

It is not only men that see and act that way. Women do it too.

It is up to each of us to watch out for our behaviors and to speak out when we see these kinds of things.

# 4. Show me that Bossom

This was a very interesting chapter.

I felt a bit conflicted. I instantly recognized the parallel with girls wearing hijabs.

I was never in favour of hijabs. I never liked the idea.

To me, and from what I learned, hijabs were just a way to prevent men from doing and thinking bad things. It was forced into women.

The other side of this is the religious meaning of a hijab. To what I say, "men should also wear it".

However, after reading this chapter, I think the way I think has changed.

It is not that men should wear it, it is that men should not force wen to wear it.

It is up to each individual to choose how they want to show or not show their body.

To a higher level, this also means not objectifying women's body.

Society should not make women wear or not wear something. 

Society does not force men to wear hijabs. Society does not force men to cover their chest at the beach.

Society should not force women to do any of those things either.

# 5. The wonderful take of Mohamed

That is a terrible story.

People being discriminated for being muslim or come from Muslim countries is terrible.

# 6. The Wait

This bottom line here is "Work Life Balance"

It is very clear how men and women are treated differently at work.

It never occured to me how some people think about that it is okay for men to sacrifice family time and it is not okay for women to sacrifice family time.

I actually enforce on myself to have a very clear distinction between my work time and my life time.

I have one phone for work and I put it away when I am done working.

I try really hard to always finish working at 5pm and I almost never accept meetings that are after 5pm. When I do, I make sure to set aside some time to not work.

I also made me think further into how we divide tasks at home. For example, I felt that it wouls be completely okay for me to take my future kid to day care in the morning and have my wife pick her up in the evening. However, now I believe that both of us should take our kid in the morning and pick her up after work.

While keeping it very clear that after work, really means after work.

# 8. Work

This chapter is about how we should work less.

The main point I got from it was how unfairly distributed wealth is. Owners of companies/factories gain a lot more money from the business then the workers.

The book claims that universal basic income is a better solution and it could be, but in my opinion it needs to be tested really well before being implemented.

# 9. Check your Pussy

This chapter talks about how unstudied the female orgasmic organ is known.

Not a lot of attention and research has been done on it. Most material on female pleasure is all about penetration while that is not from where most women have sexual pleasure.

This again hits on how male centric everything is. Penetration is about the pleasure that men feel during sex and not really about the female pleasure side.

# 10. Just another guy from the hood

This chapter talks about police brutality.

The more I read and get in touch with people from other parts of the world, the more I see that the there is a lot of police brutality everywhere. That sucks.

A lot of people say "it is just one bad apple in the tree"

Well then let's focus on that because the tree is getting rotten. The other apples should talk about it and the bad apples should be seemed out and removed fr the police.

The police should be protecting people and not making people afraid of them.

# 11. Chill Out

Women are always being told to "chill out" and to "stand up for themselves"

When they do stand up for themselves, like being angry at someone else (for in appropriate comments) they get back a "chill out" and the one who ends up being sorry is the woman.

It shouldn't be like this.

The author offers some suggestions about how to express their anger by calmly expressing them or not laughing at sexiest jokes.

That can work for sure, but we need to teach the future generations to be better.

# 12. The Holidays

Next time I hear someone saying "holidays" instead of "maternity leave" I am going to call them out.

This is one of the topics I am well aware.

I want to be and share 100% (if not more) of the burden when my wife and I have kids.

She would have gone 9 months of pregnancy and the birth. I should be responsible for more than 50% of the responsibilities of the new born baby.

My wife will need to time to recover. She deserves it and I will give it to her.
