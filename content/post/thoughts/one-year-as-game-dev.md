so! ...
Today, October 19th 2022, marks 1 year since I started my career as a professional gameplay engineer!  
TL;DR: 12 year old Tiago would be proud! ‚ù§Ô∏è; 32 year old Tiago is loving the change and still learning every day.  

To mark this one year of working as a game dev every day, I will revisit what I wrote a few days before starting the new position.  
- I have never published those thoughts until now, if you read you will know why. It is mainly about how I was feeling.
- link to post

# Who is this post for?
I wrote this for myself.  
I am not spending a lot of energy on making sure other people will be able to understand what I wrote.  
This is mostly a moment of reflection and celebration that I want to record for future Tiago.  
However, if you do end up reading through and you have any comments, questions - feel free to reach out to me!

note: as I finish writing this... I have realized how massive this became. X.x

# Fuck Yeahs!
(or in other words highlights of the year that has passed üòä)
- I am working on a game for one of the biggest brands and studios in the world! 
- The people I work with now are as awesome as the people I used to work with before!
- I work with people in many different roles and backgrounds. I really enjoy this! So many kick ass gameplay engineers, producers, technical artists, vfx artists, writers and the list goes on ...
- If somone told me that I would learn as much I have in this one year... I would not believe it. The depth and breath of learning that I have had to do in this one year has been mind blowing to me. So many talented people to learn from and get feedback from. So many cool challenges to tackle. I learn something new-almost-every-day.

# The parts that suck...
- I haven't really worked on my game side projects as often as I used to. Maybe it is because I get my fill of game dev at work and I don't feel like doing it after work? maybe it just because I have had a lot of personal stuff going on outside of work and that leaves me with little energy to work on my projects? maybe I will have a better answer in the future
- I am a gameplay engineer. This means I don't actually do much game design. Someone else has that job and I help realize that vision. So I don't get to exercise those skills as much as I used to in my personal projects. I do get to observe closely how people go about it and be part of discussions so there is a lot I can learn from that... I do like learning through experimentation tho, so that is why I guess this sucks haha. The upside is that I would never be able to do alone what we are doing as a team.

# Looking back at my time at Microsoft
I am really grateful for my time there.  
The time I spent there really shaped the growth mindset that I have today.  
That is largely due to the amazing managers, peers, leaders, mentors that I had.  
Making the decision to leave was the hardest career decision I ever did.

# Looking back at making the transition
I knew I had to make a switch and work on making games as a full time job.  
I also knew that I wanted to do it for a big game, even tho I knew I woul very likely enjoy working on a smaller team.
Regardless, making the change was a very scary idea.  

What really helped to make the decision to make the transition was:

## 1. Talk to some of my mentors about it
They really helped me ask myself questions that I wasn't thinking about.  

## 2. Do more of the game dev work in a group/team setting (#HomeTeamGameDev)
The HomeTeamGameDev group helped me solidify that I really enjoyed making games.  
This is actually a super fun group. Hopefully my personal life will get into a more stable routine soon and I will be able to join the group again.  

## 3. Talking to people that were in the game industry
The main person to call out was Chris DeLeon.
Chris was one of the main people I talked to. (he created HomeTeamGameDev)
He gave me the confidence to actually apply for a job.  
I remember him saying something to the effect of that he saw I had the skills and what I needed was to figure out a way in.
(and then gave me some valuable advice on how to go about it)

## 4. Support from my wife
My wife was extremely supportive. Emotionally and financially.  
She knows me like no one else and she knew I had to make the switch.  
She was also onboard with making any changes in our life to account for the pay cut I would be getting.

# Looking back at my first year at Ubisoft's Red Storm studio
This is the part that I revist what I wrote one year ago.

## First few days, weeks, months...
This period was tough.  
Luckly, people can be wonderful and they were. I felt included from day one.  

As a recap...  
Prior to joining, I was feeling anxious and insecure:  
- "How fast can I start making an impact?"
- "Will people judge me if I don't know how to do 'X'?"

Once I joined, I felt overwhelmed:
- "wow... I have never used Jira and Confluence before... this looks wildly confusing"
- "so many custom tools and processes..."
- "how do I wrap my head around this game's code?"
- "what are all these acronyms mean?"
- "What do people mean when they X, Y, Z... ? it sounds like this word has more meaning that what I understand"
- the list goes on...

As weeks and months went by, I started to understand and to become more familiar with the tools, processes, roles, and structures.  
Like I said, the people who helped me ramp up, the people in my team, the overall project structure and support were key on helping me get through all those feelings.

so to be specific, here are the key areas that I think were very important to me in that period.

### My onboarding buddy, Nick
Nick checked in with me pretty much every day and almost always finished our conversations with a version of "anything else on your mind? Anything confusing or that needs clarification?".  
That was extremely helpful, I am super grateful for his help.  

### My manager, Bobby
Bobby was super helpful in so many different ways. He still is - almost every day.  
So when I joined, he made me feel part of the team from day one.  
Bobby has, what it seems to me, a very natural way of making people feel included and with connecting with people.
I learned a lot from just observing his communication style.  

From a technical stand point,   
Bobby helped me - a lot - in ramping up on the various systems in our team, in the project and the structure of the project at a code and organizational level. What I appreciated the most is how he was able to make time to guide me through all that.  

### My immediate team!!
This is the best team in the project! no bias...  
One of my biggest fears about moving to a whole new company/team was... "what if I end up working with a bunch of assholes?"
My immediate team put those worries away in no time, everyone was so welcoming and friendly! ‚ù§Ô∏è  
  
I am trying to find words to describe how they went about it...  
... and as I try to put into words, all I can do is smile from remembering how I felt xD (too emotional?)  
So I guess... it was all the little things? Like daily off topic chats, jokes and so on.  
Nothing really in particular I guess? Just being normal, friendly people who I would love to hang out with even outside of work.  

### The IT, Tech team, content management!
These are "the heroes we need... not the ones we deserve..."    
I don't think we thank them enough. They keep project alive in so many ways.
I had little to no downtime during my onboarding, all issues I had were quickly resolved and most of my onboarding was done on day one.  

## Making an impact and Gaining confidence  (5~8 months in?)
One of the best advice I heard about making an impact on a team was actually really simple...  
- "Be helpful... Listen to what people are saying and help them."

In more specific terms,  
what are they trying to achieve? what issues are they having? what help are they asking for? what is the issue that keeps getting discussed?  
Once you know what these things are, go and help solve it.  

Once you have done that for a while and it is your turn to bring up problems that you need help with, people will likely listen to you and maybe even help. (don't count on getting help, but you will likely get help from people you helped before).  

So it is clear how that helps in making an impact.  
How about gaining confidence?  
Solving problems that other people are having, allows you to get gain confidence that you belong in this group because you are solvig problems that they have.

I have used this approach in different settings/situations.  
It has worked really well and I will likely continue to use it.

## Present time
I believe that I have been making a lot of good impact in the project.  
People have explicitly told me so many times and in different formats.
