# How do you express love?

For my dad, love was expressed through acts of service.

Years ago, I asked him if he ever wished he had been compensated more for his work developing the FlexFuel technology—a breakthrough in Brazil's auto industry that is now found in most cars worldwide. His response stayed with me: "It doesn't matter. What matters is the positive impact it has on people's lives and the world."

That mindset was one of the key aspects that defined his life. Whether it was helping a friend, a neighbor, or his community, he always stepped up to make things better.

As I've spoken to people who knew him, one theme keeps emerging: "Your dad helped me so much. I remember when…"

His generosity and selflessness left an enduring impact, not only on his family but on everyone around him. He was an extraordinary example of what it means to be a father, a friend, and a world citizen.
