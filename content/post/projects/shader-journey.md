# My Journey with Shaders in Godot
Working closely with Tech Artists has always left me in awe of what they can achieve with code. I was fortunate to be part of a team where my teammates were eager to walk me through the intricacies of shaders.

To better collaborate with them, I read the Unity Shader Bible. This book provided a solid foundation and helped me understand more about what my coworkers were doing. I remember thinking that my next step in this shader journey would be to experiment with different techniques and examples.

However, I got busy with other projects until I stumbled upon a book that guides using shaders in Godot, an engine I recently fell in love with.

As I started going through the book, I decided to create a little web viewer to share what I’ve been learning in this space.
