      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was taking a class in called &amp;ldquo;How To Make Great Decisions&amp;rdquo; at the Seattle community college (thanks Microsoft for sponsoring it!),&lt;br&gt;
I had to keep a daily journal. One of the questions I had to answer in one of these days was &amp;ldquo;What is your motto?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I thought about it, my mind went straight to a message that I used to written on a mirror right outside my bedroom.&lt;br&gt;
The message was &amp;ldquo;The Staying Speed = The Right Effort + Time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was something I came up with a long time ago when I used to practice kung fu. I used to read a lot about Jeet Kune Do and quotes/teachings from Bruce Lee and in those, I derived this motto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To me, the meaning behind &amp;ldquo;The Staying Speed&amp;rdquo; is&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip;about finding the right amount of time and effort needed to reach a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put too little effort and time (how often you do something) and you won&amp;rsquo;t accomplish it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put too much effort and time and you might get burned out, bored, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Staying Speed&amp;rdquo; is&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
the right balance of the amount of effort and time you put into a goal.&lt;br&gt;
The speed is not always the same. It depends not only on what you are working on, but your emotional state as well.
Knowing that, allows you to recognize when it is too little and when it is too much. From there you can adjust your staying speed to accomplish your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first table!</title>

      <guid>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/projects/first-diy-table/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/imgs/woodwork/first-diy-table-07.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;My first table!&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-did-i-build-a-table&#34;&gt;Why did I build a table?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work desk was bending after about 1 year of working from home.&lt;br&gt;
My office equipment is actually pretty heavy.&lt;br&gt;
So I decided to build a table!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-not-just-buy-one&#34;&gt;Why not just buy one?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like building things.&lt;br&gt;
and some youtube videos claimed I could make one for under $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and  the biggest reasons were that if I build one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;would be fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would learn a new skill!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-i-go-about-it&#34;&gt;How did I go about it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched tons and tons of youtube videos to learn the different techniques and styles for building a table.&lt;br&gt;
I mentioned to my buddy Matt that I wanted to build a table and he told me that he had ALL THE TOOLS! for building a table.&lt;br&gt;
He saved me a lof of money on renting/buying the tools üòÅ
(Thanks Matt!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan was to build something like a workbench.
Instead of having a full frame at the bottom, I wanted to space for my chair and legs.&lt;br&gt;
I also love tables that can easily move, so I knew I had to put some casters on it as well üòà&lt;br&gt;
(the casters definitely pushed the cost to over $100)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mistakes&#34;&gt;Mistakes!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a couple of rookie mistakes while building the table (as most people do when trying things for the first time).&lt;br&gt;
The biggest mistake was getting the wrong measurements, but I was able to turn those bugs into features of my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bug-to-feature-1&#34;&gt;Bug to Feature #1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legs were a bit too short, so instead of having the legs go all the way up to the top frame, they are a bit lower, which gave me the right height and it gave a little space where I can hang my headset on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bug-to-feature-2&#34;&gt;Bug to Feature #2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got my plywood, I asked them to cut to the wrong size.&lt;br&gt;
I had the right measurements, but I had this &amp;ldquo;imposter syndrome&amp;rdquo; when I was buying the plywood and I told them the wrong measurement&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
but now! I have a little door at the top of my table which I can pass cables below or easily hook things to the power strip I added on the table üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-here-is-my-first-diy-workbenchtable&#34;&gt;So here is my first DIY Workbench/Table&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Materials

        alt=&#34;The Materials&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My First 2 by 4 frame!

        alt=&#34;my first 2 by 4 frame!&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laying the legs and casters

        alt=&#34;Laying the legs and casters&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;legs, bottom frame casters all attached

&lt;p&gt;Staining the top
&lt;img  src=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/imgs/woodwork/first-diy-table-06.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Staining the top&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done! and with all my work equipment setup
&lt;img  src=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/imgs/woodwork/first-diy-table-07.jpg&#34;
        alt=&#34;Done! and with all my work equipment setup&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;am-i-going-to-do-more&#34;&gt;Am I going to do more?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely!&lt;br&gt;
I have plans to build a table for a tv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my plan is to actually undo a table I put together a couple of years ago and make two tables out of it. Use one and sell the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some good youtube channels that explain how to build stuff with simple tools and materials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChKlSK39lLg8eZHIX0iVzLA&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;DIY Creators&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD02RAib9K0kob8UMWwLMSA&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Pneumatic Addict&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use only them as your resources. There are tons of other videos and blogs where you can learn bits and pieces about what you might want to create.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello World!</title>
      <link>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/hello-world/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/hello-world/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-am-i-starting-a-blog&#34;&gt;Why am I starting a blog?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am creating this blog as a sort of a personal growth record keeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts I am creating are usually around the areas of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;books I am reading or listening to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my endless quest of working on projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a public &amp;ldquo;fuck yeah list&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read and listen to book, I take notes.
Doing that really helps to critically understand what I am reading and it helps to retain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short words, this method goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write what you think you are going to be reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read a chapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write about what you have just read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;before you start reading the book again, read through your notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some videos on the method I described:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-GtGH57J9I&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Big Think : How to remember everything you read | Shane Parrish&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fvUYmJcqWg&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Big Think : Want to get more from books? Stop reading them cover to cover. | Shane Parrish&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;projects&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been tracking all the projects that I have been working on.
There are over 20 of them. None are never trully done.&lt;br&gt;
There is always something else to thinker with. Something else to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are my creative outlet. It is probably one of the things I enjoy doing the most in life.
Some of them are pretty cool and worth sharing, I think :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fuck-yeah-list&#34;&gt;Fuck Yeah List&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is right. A &amp;ldquo;Fuck Yeah List&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;
I learned this &amp;ldquo;concept&amp;rdquo; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.docjamesw.com/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Doc James Whittaker&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
It is simple a list of accomplishments that I am proud of.&lt;br&gt;
Whenever I need a pick me up, I can come here and read &amp;ldquo;my fuck yeah list&amp;rdquo; and feel better about myself.&lt;/p&gt;
