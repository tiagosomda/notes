      <title>Unreal Engine Project Launcher CLI</title>
      <link>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/projects/ue-launcher-cli/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! how are you?  I hope you are doing well&lt;br&gt;
I made a cool tool, so I thought about writing about it a bit.&lt;br&gt;
It is an unreal engine launcher cli that makes it easier to open, close, and regenerate uproject/vssolutions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can find the source code here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tiagosomda/ue-launcher-cli&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://github.com/tiagosomda/ue-launcher-cli&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img style=&#34;width:100%&#34; src=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/imgs/projects/ue-launcher-cli-examples.gif&#34; alt=&#34;unreal engine project launcher gif with examples&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-did-i-create-this&#34;&gt;Why did I create this?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I seem to have to do a lot is to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;close unreal and visual studio,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;delete generated files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;right click the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;select to regenerate it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;launch visual studio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;launch the unreal project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img style=&#34;height:250px&#34; src=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/imgs/memes/getting-through-it.png&#34; alt=&#34;meme of me being tired of typing these commands over and over&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &amp;hellip; those are a lot of steps üòµ &lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt; &amp;hellip; and many of them are mouse clicks!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;since I almost always have a cli open to make git commits, I started by creating a alias that would launch the unreal project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then I realized that I could probably regenerate the files as well,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and then why not close any unreal and visual studio instances for my project before regenerating it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-it&#34;&gt;Building it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since I had to create a powershell script that would list the currently open projects, so I enlisted copilot to see if it could spit out some functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It did and it mostly worked, so that got me started into building this cli.&lt;br&gt;
Once I had things working, I wrapped everything in a powershell module and started using it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It worked super well, so I put it up on github and posted about it on linked in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;was-this-really-necessary&#34;&gt;Was this really necessary?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not really&amp;hellip; and there might be a better way to go about it than this workflow, but so far, spending some time on it was rewarding and has been helpful to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-do-you-think&#34;&gt;What do you think?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you end up using or making additions, modifications, or variation of it, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ps: I have some other useful scripts here as well if you are interested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/tiagosomda&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://gist.github.com/tiagosomda&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Being a Game Dev at a game studio, one year into it</title>
      <link>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/one-year-as-game-dev/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/one-year-as-game-dev/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;so! üòäüòç&lt;br&gt;
Today marks 1 year since I started my career as a professional gameplay engineer!&lt;br&gt;
yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 year old Tiago would be proud! ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32 year old Tiago is loving the change and still learning every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-did-i-write-this-for&#34;&gt;Who did I write this for?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not spending a lot of energy on making sure other people will be able to understand what I wrote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a reflection and celebration that I want to record for future Tiago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you do end up reading through and you have any comments, thoughts, questions, etc - feel free to reach out to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, this is how I felt a few days prior to starting as a full timeg game dev:s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;link to post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note: as I finish writing this&amp;hellip; I have realized how massive it became&amp;hellip; üòµ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fuck-yeahs&#34;&gt;Fuck Yeahs!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in other words, celebratory highlights üòä&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üòé I am working on a game for one of the biggest brands and studios in the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üòç The people I work with now are as awesome as the people I used to work with before!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üíØ I work with people in many different roles and backgrounds. I really enjoy this! So many kick ass gameplay engineers, producers, technical artists, vfx artists, writers and the list goes on &amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ü§Ø If somone told me that I would learn as much I have in this one year&amp;hellip; I would not believe it. The amount I technical knowledge I gained in this one year has been mind blowing to me. So many talented people to learn from and get feedback from! So many cool challenges to tackle. I learn something new-almost-every-day!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üòé I am now a lead for one of the coolest components in the project!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üí™ I got promoted to senior gameplay engineer!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ü•∞ I got the title role of &amp;ldquo;Everything Everywhere All At Once&amp;rdquo; in a game jam hosted by Red Storm along with NCSU students (to be honest, I think this is the highlight of the year. I feel very honoured. I love this movie.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;looking-back-at-my-time-at-microsoft&#34;&gt;Looking back at my time at Microsoft&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really grateful for my time there.&lt;br&gt;
The time I spent there really shaped the growth mindset that I have today.&lt;br&gt;
That is largely due to the amazing managers, peers, leaders, mentors that I had.&lt;br&gt;
Making the decision to leave was the hardest career decision I ever did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;looking-back-at-making-the-transition&#34;&gt;Looking back at making the transition&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I had to make a switch and work on making games as a full time job.&lt;br&gt;
It is something I wanted to do since I was 12. Life took me to other paths and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change a thing. Still, that was something itching in my mind&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip; but it was hard to act on it. I was getting paid really well, working with a kickass team on a kickass project.&lt;br&gt;
I was in a very confortable zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in a confortable zone is also why I wanted to make a change.&lt;br&gt;
I was too confortable and not expanding my skill set into the areas that I deeply wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mentors&#34;&gt;Mentors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They really helped me ask myself questions that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thinking about.&lt;br&gt;
Talking to them about it helped me understand the reasons why I wanted to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hometeamgamedev&#34;&gt;HomeTeamGameDev&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HomeTeamGameDev group helped me solidify that I really enjoyed making games.&lt;br&gt;
This is actually a super fun group. Hopefully my personal life will get into a more stable routine soon and I will be able to join the group again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gain-confidence-to-even-apply-for-jobs&#34;&gt;Gain confidence to even apply for jobs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main person to call out was Chris DeLeon (one of the perks of HomeTeamGameDev is that you get to have some mentorship sessions with people that are/were in the game industry) I scheduled one with Chris and he was able (maybe without knowing) give me the confidence to actually apply for a job.&lt;br&gt;
I remember him saying something to the effect that he saw I had the skills and what I needed was to figure out a way of getting my foot in the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;support-from-my-wife&#34;&gt;Support from my wife&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife was extremely supportive. Emotionally and financially.&lt;br&gt;
She knows me like no one else and she knew I had to make the switch.&lt;br&gt;
She was also onboard with making any changes in our life to account for the pay cut I would be getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;looking-back-at-my-first-year-at-ubisofts-red-storm-studio&#34;&gt;Looking back at my first year at Ubisoft&amp;rsquo;s Red Storm studio&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part that I revist what I wrote one year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-few-days-weeks-months&#34;&gt;First few days, weeks, months&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This period was emotionally tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a recap&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
Prior to joining, I was feeling anxious and insecure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How fast can I start making an impact?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Will people judge me if I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Am I doing the best decision here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I joined, I felt overwhelmed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;wow&amp;hellip; I have never used Jira and Confluence before&amp;hellip; this looks wildly confusing&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;so many custom tools and processes&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;how do I wrap my head around this game&amp;rsquo;s code?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;what are all these acronyms?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do people mean when they say X, Y, Z&amp;hellip; ? it sounds like this word has more meaning that it seems&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the list goes on&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As weeks and months went by, I started to understand and to become more familiar with the tools, processes, roles, and structures.&lt;br&gt;
Like I said, the people I work with are amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to be specific, here are the key people/areas that I think were very important to me in that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-onboarding-buddy-nick&#34;&gt;My onboarding buddy, Nick&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick checked in with me pretty much every day and almost always finished our conversations with a version of &amp;ldquo;anything else on your mind? Anything confusing or that needs clarification?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;
That was extremely helpful, I am super grateful for his help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-manager-bobby&#34;&gt;My manager, Bobby&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bobby was super helpful in so many different ways. He still is - almost every day.&lt;br&gt;
So when I joined, he made me feel part of the team from day one.&lt;br&gt;
Bobby has, what it seems to me, a very natural way of making people feel included and with connecting with people.
I learned a lot from just observing his communication style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a technical stand point,&lt;br&gt;
Bobby helped me - a lot - in ramping up on the various systems in our team, in the project and the structure of the project at a code and organizational level. What I appreciated the most is how he was able to make time to guide me through all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-immediate-team&#34;&gt;My immediate team!!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best team in the project! no bias&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
One of my biggest fears about moving to a whole new company/team was&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;what if I end up working with a bunch of assholes?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
My immediate team put those worries away in no time, everyone was so welcoming and friendly! ‚ù§Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to find words to describe how they went about it&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip; and as I try to put into words, all I can do is smile from remembering how I felt xD (too emotional?)&lt;br&gt;
So I guess&amp;hellip; it was all the little things? Like daily off topic chats, jokes and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-it-tech-team-content-management&#34;&gt;The IT, Tech team, content management!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are &amp;ldquo;the heroes we need&amp;hellip; not the ones we deserve&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t think we thank them enough. They keep project alive in so many ways.
I had little to no downtime during my onboarding, all issues I had were quickly resolved and most of my onboarding was done on day one.  This keeps being true every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-an-impact-and-gaining-confidence--58-months-in&#34;&gt;Making an impact and gaining confidence  (5~8 months in?)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best advice I heard about making an impact on a team was actually really simple&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Be helpful&amp;hellip; Listen to what people are saying and help them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more specific terms,&lt;br&gt;
what are they trying to achieve? what issues are they having? what help are they asking for? what is the issue that keeps getting discussed?&lt;br&gt;
Once you know what these things are, go and help solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have done that for a while and it is your turn to bring up problems that you need help with, people will likely listen to you and maybe even help. (don&amp;rsquo;t count on getting help, but you will likely get help from people you helped before).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is clear how that helps in making an impact.&lt;br&gt;
How about gaining confidence?&lt;br&gt;
Solving problems that other people are having, allows you to get gain confidence that you belong in this group because you are solvig problems that they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used this approach in different settings/situations.&lt;br&gt;
It has worked really well and I will likely continue to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;present-time&#34;&gt;Present time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now a lead on one the coolest components in our project.&lt;br&gt;
I am super happy and proud to be doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, I go promoted to a senior level!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot non-programming work that comes with it, and a lot of work and people management. This isn&amp;rsquo;t new to me. It is not my favorite type of work, but I do know that I can do it well, so I am more than happy to setup up to the role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has been a blast!&lt;br&gt;
Read that fuck yeah list again!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dealing with leaving my comfort zone</title>
      <link>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/dealing-with-getting-out-of-my-comfort-zone/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/dealing-with-getting-out-of-my-comfort-zone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(not proof read - sorry for all the grammar mistakes xD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I left my job at Microsoft as a Software Engineer.&lt;br&gt;
In a few days, I start my new job as a Gameplay Engineer at Red Storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had one week off between job, so my wife and I went to visit family and meet our new niece.&lt;br&gt;
I filled my iddle time with prepping for my new role, playing video games and I started feeling a wide set of of emotions regarding what this new chapter in my professional life would be like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled up the &amp;ldquo;Wheel of Emotions&amp;rdquo; and started using it to recognize and understand my feelings. These are what I identified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fearful : [Anxious : (Overwhelmed, Worried), Insecure : (Inadequate, Inferior)]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy : [Interested : (Curious, Inquisitive), Proud : (Successful), Optimistic : (Hopeful)]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two core emotions are &lt;strong&gt;Happy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Fearful&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
I was not planning on making this public, but perhaps it can be of use to someone who may be feeling something similar at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;happy&#34;&gt;Happy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am definitely happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got the job offer at Red Storm, I was dancing around. I felt &lt;strong&gt;successful&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been doing game dev as a hobby for a long time. Making games is my favorite hobby and now, it is becoming my main daily craft. #fuckyeah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even tho I already have some game dev experience, I mostly learned it in college (8+ years ago). I was &lt;strong&gt;curious&lt;/strong&gt; about  what books were out here now and what could I learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by getting two game design pattern books. One for general game patterns and another with a focus in Unity. I devoured them as if they were Sherlock Holmes or Perry Rhodan novels. I became more &lt;strong&gt;inquisitive&lt;/strong&gt; about some details and I got two more books, one in Unity VR development and another in Unity Game Optimizations. As of this writing, I am almost done with these books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am actually not a big reader of tech books, but I am very &lt;strong&gt;interested&lt;/strong&gt; in the topic of making software where the ultimate goal is to have the users enjoy and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading all these books made me very &lt;strong&gt;hopeful&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;proud!&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of the patterns and optimizations described were things that I had done in my hobby projects. This made me &lt;strong&gt;optimistic&lt;/strong&gt; about my decision of turning my hobby into my main craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, reading those books also made me feel other things&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fearful&#34;&gt;Fearful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading all those books was great! I learned a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned that there is a lot I still don&amp;rsquo;t know and certainly there are many things I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the take aways that I got from the game design pattern books is that, for constraint environments there is a decision to be made on performance vs abstraction. I have been heavily designing and building things with abstractions, extensibility, maintainaiy as the main aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and so&amp;hellip; those ANTs started crawling all over me and taking a lot of my mental cycles (ANTs = Automatic Negative Thoughts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will I do well in this role?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will people judge me for not knowing X, Y, Z?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the list goes on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those negative thoughts driving my mind, I started feeling anxious. After going through the &amp;ldquo;Wheel of Emotions&amp;rdquo;, I indentified that anxious feeling as being &lt;strong&gt;insecure&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;worried&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife asked to read what I was writing and after she read all of the above she asked me if I felt anything like that when I joined Microsoft. The main thing I remember is feeling was &lt;strong&gt;insecure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back on my 8 years of experience, I remembered things that have put away those fearful emotions and have driven all those ANTs from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-this-set-of-feelings-tell-me&#34;&gt;What does this set of feelings tell me?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of happy and fearful feelings tells me that I am leaving my comfort zone. That brings fear and that is okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my experience, people are mostly awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I told my team I was leaving, I was very anxious and then the response I got back was of love and well wishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through out my career, I have learned so much with and from my peers. We helped each other to solve the problems we were facing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-adventure-ahead&#34;&gt;The Adventure Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can never truly know what awaits you beyond the &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo;, but I have gotten a good vibe from my future peers that have interviewed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I can extrapolate based on my previous experience at Microsoft, that my new role at Red Storm is filled exciting challenges that will become opportunities to learn and grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the adventure ahead is exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Week @ HomeTeam GameDev</title>
      <link>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/hometeam-gamedev-first-week/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/hometeam-gamedev-first-week/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-i-stumble-onto-hometeam-gamedev&#34;&gt;How did I stumble onto HomeTeam GameDev?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been looking for a place where I could collaborate with others on a game.&lt;br&gt;
This is something I already do with some friends. However, I wanted to do it in a more global scale.&lt;br&gt;
I started looking into open source games and I did find quite a few, but the games themselves were already pretty well stabilished and I didn&amp;rsquo;t see much about what I could do on them.&lt;br&gt;
Fast forward a couple of weeks, I am in a training and someone drops the name &amp;ldquo;HomeTeam GameDev&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;
I take a look and I get very skeptical. &amp;ldquo;Wait&amp;hellip; what? a paid &amp;lsquo;membership&amp;rsquo; to join a group where all the games made are free and everyone owns everything they make? and all assets are made within the group itself?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
That just sounded weird to me, but I decided to reach out and see if I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-week&#34;&gt;First Week&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-experience&#34;&gt;Initial Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I joined the group, I was amazed by the amount of content and organization of the group.&lt;br&gt;
I dove right into that info and started watching the weekly videos of the project and I really liked what I saw.&lt;br&gt;
I cloned the repo for two games (Ionic Defender and Duck Slayer) and I started adding things.&lt;br&gt;
It was really weird at first to just make changes by following a task board without asking anyone for more info on it.&lt;br&gt;
I went to sleep and next morning, someone had built upon that.&lt;br&gt;
Day after day the same thing happened.&lt;br&gt;
Within that week, I saw Ionic Defender go from what to me looked like a prototype into a ready to be released game. &lt;br&gt;
It was trully amazing to see that happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-mentors&#34;&gt;The Mentors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the many years of content that got created by this group on how to work well within this culture, there are also mentors in the group.&lt;br&gt;
They reached out to me give me tips here and there to communicate better (i.e. use each tool for their specific purpose), read here about more details on how to pitch a game, go there to see the bio of the people in the group.&lt;br&gt;
This was a great set of guidance that really helped me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-connections&#34;&gt;The Connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can already tell that the people in this group are very friendly and I feel like are interests align really well.&lt;br&gt;
I know that the connections I am building here will be very interesting.&lt;br&gt;
The group creator (Chris DeLeon) also posted about a panel hosted by IGDA LA that was word for word answering a question I had (more on that later).&lt;br&gt;
I went to the panel and heard many inspiring and motivating stories. People in the audience asked question that I had and did not know I had.&lt;br&gt;
The answers were very personal and honest. I loved it. I took so many notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something special here at HomeTeam GameDev.&lt;br&gt;
I have seen similar structures at &amp;ldquo;Maker Spaces&amp;rdquo;, but this is different somehow.
I am really looking forward to understanding why I think that there is something special about this structure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Career Panel @ Geeking Out Kids of Color</title>
      <link>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/gokic-career-panel-2021-04/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/thoughts/gokic-career-panel-2021-04/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I volunteered for one hour to speak at a career panel.&lt;br&gt;
The panel was organized by GOKiC (Geeking Out Kids of Color) and Collective Youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I helped start GOKiC as a board member.&lt;br&gt;
Recently, I stepped out as a board member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was really great to see the work of the non profit from the point of view of a volunteer.&lt;br&gt;
It made me really proud to see how organized and big the organization has grown. ‚ù§&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some awesome people at GOKiC making a real impact on people&amp;rsquo;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;career-panel-ask&#34;&gt;Career Panel Ask&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOKiC approached me about the career panel via email.&lt;br&gt;
I signed up through their website.&lt;br&gt;
Soon after I was contact with some guidelines on what we could speak about during the career panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review where you‚Äôre from and how you got to where you are now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you overcome challenges in education and work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is it like working in your role?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What‚Äôs one piece of advice you would give to a college student?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and then a QA session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-did-i-present&#34;&gt;What did I present?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is, let me know if any of it was helpful to you: &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/misc/tiago-gokic-career-panel-2021-04.pdf&#34;&gt;career panel presentation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you have any questions, send me a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;qa-session&#34;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A Session&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly the students were very quiet&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip; except for one student who typed in the chat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want to be a Software Engineer at Microsoft&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked her about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there something we can help you with?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She mentioned how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She heard about software engineering as a really cool thing and how Microsoft was really awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She also said she was learning programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the panel, encouraged her and told her that she was doing the right thing (learning to code) to become a software engineer.&lt;br&gt;
After the panel was done talking, I really wanted to know how I could help, so I asked her what year of college she was in or what year in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She came off mute&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip;and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am in middle school&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;think about it carefully&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
That student in middle school was attending a panel for college kids about careers and she was seeking advice on how to become a software engineer at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. What? Did I hear that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yep. I did and it made my week. ‚ù§&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;rsquo;t know how to end this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except by saying how amazed I am by the drive of that middle school student and how GOKiC has enabled her to connect with people who perhaps were able to give advice that may help her achieve her goals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The gito alias</title>
      <link>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/hacks/gito-alias/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/hacks/gito-alias/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img style=&#34;width:100%&#34; src=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/imgs/misc/gito.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;gito matrix&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often need to open a repo&amp;rsquo;s webpage to look at PRs, get code reference to others and many other reasons.&lt;br&gt;
So I created an alias that makes navigating from my terminal to the repo&amp;rsquo;s webpage super easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coworker actually showed me part of this.&lt;br&gt;
He had an alias that echoed the repo&amp;rsquo;s url.&lt;br&gt;
So I thought, &amp;ldquo;oh, I can make a command that opens a browser window with that output!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the git command to get the url is pretty simple: &lt;code&gt;git config --get remote.origin.url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After that, do some regex magic and open a browser with the url! üòÑ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bash: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/tiagosomda/28be45e7b22e72a70996f6ba2b218a39&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://gist.github.com/tiagosomda/28be45e7b22e72a70996f6ba2b218a39&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;powershell: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/tiagosomda/f6c97a9ffbfb686048895cca2c099b58&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://gist.github.com/tiagosomda/f6c97a9ffbfb686048895cca2c099b58&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you improve it or if you have any other useful commands, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Mental Load : What do Women think about?</title>
      <link>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/books/the-mental-load/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/books/the-mental-load/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img style=&#34;width:100%&#34; src=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/imgs/books/the-mental-load.png&#34; alt=&#34;book cover for the Mental Load&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently read &amp;lsquo;The Mental Load: A Feminist Comic&amp;rsquo; By Emma and I learned a lot! As I read each chapter, I took notes and today I reflected on them. I highly recommend this book to the women and men of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-this-book-about&#34;&gt;What is this book about?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39196352-the-mental-load#:~:text=The%20mental%20load%20is%20an%20intersectional%20feminist%20comic,the%20main%20focus%20here%20is%20on%20the%20domestic.&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;review by Nancy O&amp;rsquo;Toole explains it well&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental load is an intersectional feminist comic that uses simple illustrations to convey current issues. While the content goes beyond this, the main focus here is on the domestic. We already know about the imbalance in hours spent on activities such as cooking, cleaning, and child care, and how that negatively impacts women (especially those who work full time), but what about the impact of the mental load? The strain that comes from mentally balancing the dozens of seemingly small tasks in the household that men are, too often, blind to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-did-i-read-this-book&#34;&gt;Why did I read this book?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the review says above says &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;small tasks in the household that men are, too often, blind to&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; I wanted to know more about what those things were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let me tell you about 3 things that prompted me to read this book once I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first--my-mom&#34;&gt;First : My Mom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got married, my mom would tell/ask me if I was doing my part in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip; and honestly, I thought I was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;second--deciding-to-be-equal-partners&#34;&gt;Second : Deciding to be Equal Partners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I listened to the audio book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Moment-of-Lift-Audiobook/1250317045&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;The Moment of Lift - by Melinda Gates&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
In it, Melinda talks about how she and Bill strive to be equals in their marriage and also in their foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I thought this was a great idea!&lt;br&gt;
We do not want one of us &amp;ldquo;wearing the pants&amp;rdquo; in our relationship.&lt;br&gt;
We want to be equal partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;third--understanding-that-which-i-did-not-even-know&#34;&gt;Third : Understanding that which I did not even know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I take around 30 minutes every Sunday to have a marriage meeting.&lt;br&gt;
The meeting name sounds very formal, but this is actually a very intimate moment of our lives where we reflect on the week that has passed.&lt;br&gt;
It is composed of four sections where we get to appreciate each other, discuss chores, plan for good times, and talk about our problems and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we talked about was how to become more equal and hence how to split up chores more evenly.&lt;br&gt;
There were some easy things that we could split, but there were also a couple of things that she did without really thinking about, but it nonetheless added to her &lt;strong&gt;Mental Load&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
As we worked through these, I realized that she did so many things around the house that I was not even aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out about marriage meetings via a podcast that my friend showed to me.&lt;br&gt;
Here is the episode: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/podcast-611-how-a-weekly-marriage-meeting-can-strengthen-your-relationship/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Art of Manliness - Podcast #611: How a Weekly Marriage Meeting Can Strengthen Your Relationship&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a book about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Reclaiming-Conversation-Power-Talk-Digital/dp/1608682234&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Marriage Meeting for Lasting Love by Marcia Naomi Berger&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;answering-why-did-i-want-to-read-this-book&#34;&gt;Answering: Why did I want to read this book?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be the best husband that I can be.&lt;br&gt;
I want to be the best men that I can be.&lt;br&gt;
I want to be a better ally to women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is too much inequality between men and women around so many parts of our society.&lt;br&gt;
It is up to each and every one of us to learn and try to be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-what-did-i-learn-from-the-book&#34;&gt;So what did I learn from the book?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should read it and make your own conclusions.&lt;br&gt;
The book is packed with very deep and important issues and yet it is very short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, here are the top five things that I want to highlight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1--you-should-have-asked&#34;&gt;1 : &amp;ldquo;You Should Have Asked&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often in a relationship, we may think that we are doing more than our partners.&lt;br&gt;
That is when little fights start, one might say &amp;ldquo;why didn&amp;rsquo;t you put the dishes in the dishwasher?&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; the other responds, &amp;ldquo;you should have asked&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
and etc&amp;hellip; the book goes into more examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, try and understand what each of you does in the house.
Ask everyone to keep a list where they add the things they are doing around the house.&lt;br&gt;
and then, once a week, review that list and start to divide them up more equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2--oh-wow-she-is-angry-calm-down-and-did-you-see-how-these-vandals-destroyed-the-city&#34;&gt;2 : &amp;ldquo;Oh wow, she is angry. Calm down&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Did you see how these vandals destroyed the city?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second chapter of the book is called &amp;ldquo;Violence of the oppressed&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;
It is about how fingers are usually pointed to the people being oppressed and not the oppressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there was A LOT of news coverage on the destruction around BlackLivesMatter protests.&lt;br&gt;
And yet, there was little talk about the inequality that black people in this country (and around the world) suffer.
There was no coverage on how black people have this gigantic mental load about what they need to do to avoid being victims of police brutality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dress well, drive nice cards, act calmly, speak well&amp;hellip; the list goes on and on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is women at work (in tech, but I am sure in other places too), they cannot act angry or express their opinions in a stern way.&lt;br&gt;
Some men in those environments see those behaviors as unfit for women, when on the other hand it is completely okay for men to act like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3--episiotomy&#34;&gt;3 : Episiotomy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a practice done during childbirth that is brutal and not necessary, in most cases.  Read more about it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/giving-birth/vaginal/qa-do-i-have-to-have-an-episiotomy&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/giving-birth/vaginal/qa-do-i-have-to-have-an-episiotomy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4--hijabs&#34;&gt;4 : Hijabs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4 in the book, &amp;ldquo;Show me that Bossom&amp;rdquo;, caught me by surprise.&lt;br&gt;
It uses a clever story that changed my views on hijab.&lt;br&gt;
I always viewed hijabs as a tool of men to oppress and control women. &lt;br&gt;
So, of course, I never liked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now, I think differently. Here is what I think about hijabs:
If a woman wants to wear a hijab. It is their right to do so.&lt;br&gt;
I won&amp;rsquo;t force them to wear or not to wear them.&lt;br&gt;
It is their body and their belief.&lt;br&gt;
They are in control of how and how much they want to show their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5--how-was-the-holiday&#34;&gt;5 : &amp;ldquo;How was the Holiday?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman takes her paid leave to take care of her newborn.&lt;br&gt;
She is welcomed back with &amp;ldquo;How was the Holiday?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Next time I hear someone saying &amp;ldquo;holidays&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;maternity leave&amp;rdquo; I am going to call them out.&lt;br&gt;
Taking care of a newborn is not a holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women who have just given birth go through so much.&lt;br&gt;
Their body needs to heal AND they are taking care of their baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got a puppy last year and woooooooow, I hear a newborn baby is soooo much more work than puppies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have since then a deeper appreciation for my parents and mad respect to single parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go read this book.
If you have men and women that you care about in your life, show them this book.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Perspective Wand : Experiencing Superluminal in VR</title>
      <link>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/projects/perspective-wand/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://notes.tiago.dev/post/projects/perspective-wand/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img style=&#34;width:100%&#34; src=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/imgs/projects/perspective-wand-000.gif&#34; alt=&#34;perspective wand example&#34;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;have-you-heard-of-superluminal&#34;&gt;Have you heard of Superluminal?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not, check it out!&lt;br&gt;
I really enjoyed playing it : &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1049410/Superliminal/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;link to Superluminal on Steam&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzles are incredible.&lt;br&gt;
It has this game mechanic that tricks your mind. Even when you understand it, it still leaves you in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know me, you know where this is going&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
I wondered how would it feel to interact with this game mechanic in the real world.&lt;br&gt;
I am really into VR and that is probably the only environment (for now) that we could experience this game mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also got me thinking&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
Is it even possible to do this in VR?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research and found this gold gem on youtube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFEIUcXCEvI&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;How do non-euclidean games work? | Bitwise&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video talks about what non-euclidian games are (super freaking cool is what they are).&lt;br&gt;
Fast forward to &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/lFEIUcXCEvI?t=646&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;10:46 in the video&lt;/a&gt;
 and it explains how the game mechanic in Superluminal works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gotta say&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip; I was a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bit Wiser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; after watching that video!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img  src=&#34;https://notes.tiago.dev/imgs/memes/ba-dum-tss.png&#34;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-does-the-game-mechanic-work&#34;&gt;How does the game mechanic work?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video puts it really well &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;as you pick up an object, its perspective stays the same, but its real size changes dramatically.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Meaning, something small that you pick up on a table, becomes really big if you point it at some place far away.&lt;br&gt;
There are all sorts of interesting puzzles that you can make with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic behind this mechanic is super simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you pick up the object, you store
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the current distance from the player to the object and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also the current scale value of the object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you move the object in the world, push it as far as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With that object in that position,
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;get that distance and initial distance stored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this gives you a ratio that you can use to calculate the scale that the object should have in this new distance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind was blown. ü§Ø&lt;br&gt;
It makes so much sense AND it is so clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-i-go-about-building-this-in-vr&#34;&gt;How did I go about building this in VR?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am familiar with making VR things in Unity, so that was an easy choice for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I decided to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first make the mechanic work in a regular 2D screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and then tackle how it work work in VR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure there would be more to it then the simple math.&lt;br&gt;
It turns out that the hardest part, to me, was figuring out where to place the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the ways I tried doing that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attempt-1-push-the-object-backwards-a-little-bit-every-frame&#34;&gt;Attempt #1: Push the object backwards a little bit every frame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That initially worked well.&lt;br&gt;
However, but once my object was far away and I looked at something that was close, when my object was already passed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a Raycast to check if whatever I was pointing at was closer to where the object currently was.&lt;br&gt;
That didn&amp;rsquo;t solve the problem entirely. The Raycast is a very thin line so the object I was holding would stay behind another object until I actually aimed into an object that was closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;attempt-2-at-every-frame-calculate-farthest-position-starting-from-the-closest-position&#34;&gt;Attempt #2: At every frame, calculate farthest position starting from the closest position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually worked out very well.&lt;br&gt;
There are probably other solutions that are more efficient.&lt;br&gt;
I actually spent a couple of hours over the weekend trying different ways, but I took a little break and remembered what my goal was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; to experience this in VR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not A Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; to make the most efficient mechanic in the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;calculating-the-farthest-the-object-can-be&#34;&gt;Calculating the farthest the object can be&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually an interesting problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we know we can place an object at a certain position?
Unity does not give us a way to do a collision check on demand given a collider (if it does, let me know!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to do that check, I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.CheckBox.html&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Unity&amp;rsquo;s Physics Check Box collision&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To define the box size, I used an approximation.
I scaled the box size to what the object&amp;rsquo;s scale would be at a certain point.&lt;br&gt;
It is not perfect, but it works with most shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-else-could-we-do-this&#34;&gt;How else could we do this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many other ways.&lt;br&gt;
I think one of the best solutions would be for each object to have a component that calculates how far it can be pushed back given an initial position and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that way, simple objects can use something like I mentioned above. Complex objects can implement something that checks for collisions using different shapes and sizes. (for example, an object with holes in it, like a donut.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mathematician in me also likes the other possibility to figure out a set of boxes which can fill an object&amp;rsquo;s space.&lt;br&gt;
That could be using in some preprocessing function or in realtime.&lt;br&gt;
During the &amp;ldquo;push back operation&amp;rdquo;, we check if any of the boxes are collisind with anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this was a weekend project. So I brought myself to focus on the task.&lt;br&gt;
(As I write this, I have this itch to go back and give these other options a try&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;experiencing-it-in-vr&#34;&gt;Experiencing it in VR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are a few things to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we pick up an object?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which direction do we push it away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-pick-up-the-object&#34;&gt;How to pick up the object?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two ways I thought about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick up the object by grabbing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a pointer (or some cool &amp;ldquo;perspective wand&amp;rdquo;) to point to select an object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grabing the object would be really cool, because it would give you the extra idea that &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t be placing this really far away, it is right here in my hands&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br&gt;
However, I would have to change how the mechanic work to actually just place the object far away, when I actually let go of the object, which meant changing my current implementation. So I decided to maybe try that later. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went with option two. Simple click pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-direction-do-we-push-it-away&#34;&gt;Which direction do we push it away?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want the object to scale in relation to the position of our eyes,
but we want to use our hands to place the object in different locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then, the direction to push the object becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;from: the middle point in between the player&amp;rsquo;s eyes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to: the location where the hand is pointing to (raycast from the hand&amp;rsquo;s/wand&amp;rsquo;s forward position to whatever we hit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is very similar to the 2D screen effect.&lt;br&gt;
Except that in that frame of view, we are always pointing at the center of the camera and the camera is always moving to where we are pointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that is it!&lt;br&gt;
It does work in VR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-it-feel-to-use-this-perspective-wand-in-vr&#34;&gt;How did it feel to use this &amp;ldquo;perspective wand&amp;rdquo; in VR?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like doing magic!
I threw together a bunch of assets in a scene and went crazy with moving them around.&lt;br&gt;
I tricked myself many times.&lt;br&gt;
I sometimes still get tricked when I place something in the sky without realizing.&lt;br&gt;
When that happens, the object starts to fall very slowing and that is what makes me realize that the object is really far away and also veeery large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;where-can-i-try-it&#34;&gt;Where can I try it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hosting a WebGL (non-vr) version that you can give a try here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unfolding-dragon.github.io/perspective-wand/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://unfolding-dragon.github.io/perspective-wand/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also built for a couple of other devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/unfolding-dragon/perspective-wand/releases/tag/v0.1&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;https://github.com/unfolding-dragon/perspective-wand/releases/tag/v0.1&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>What is my motto? this up here ^ </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was taking a class in called &amp;ldquo;How To Make Great Decisions&amp;rdquo; at the Seattle community college (thanks Microsoft for sponsoring it!),&lt;br&gt;
I had to keep a daily journal. One of the questions I had to answer in one of these days was &amp;ldquo;What is your motto?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I thought about it, my mind went straight to a message that I used to written on a mirror right outside my bedroom.&lt;br&gt;
The message was &amp;ldquo;The Staying Speed = The Right Effort + Time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was something I came up with a long time ago when I used to practice kung fu. I used to read a lot about Jeet Kune Do and quotes/teachings from Bruce Lee and in those, I derived this motto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To me, the meaning behind &amp;ldquo;The Staying Speed&amp;rdquo; is&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;hellip;about finding the right amount of time and effort needed to reach a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put too little effort and time (how often you do something) and you won&amp;rsquo;t accomplish it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put too much effort and time and you might get burned out, bored, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Staying Speed&amp;rdquo; is&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;
the right balance of the amount of effort and time you put into a goal.&lt;br&gt;
The speed is not always the same. It depends not only on what you are working on, but your emotional state as well.
Knowing that, allows you to recognize when it is too little and when it is too much. From there you can adjust your staying speed to accomplish your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
