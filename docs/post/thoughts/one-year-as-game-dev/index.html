Today marks 1 year since I started my career as a professional gameplay engineer!<br>
yay!</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 year old Tiago would be proud! ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
<li>32 year old Tiago is loving the change and still learning every day.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="who-did-i-write-this-for">Who did I write this for?</h1>
<p>myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am not spending a lot of energy on making sure other people will be able to understand what I wrote.</li>
<li>This is a reflection and celebration that I want to record for future Tiago.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you do end up reading through and you have any comments, thoughts, questions, etc - feel free to reach out to me!</p>
<p>For comparison, this is how I felt a few days prior to starting as a full timeg game dev:s</p>
<ul>
<li>link to post</li>
</ul>
<p>note: as I finish writing this&hellip; I have realized how massive it became&hellip; üòµ</p>
<h1 id="fuck-yeahs">Fuck Yeahs!</h1>
<p>in other words, celebratory highlights üòä</p>
<ul>
<li>üòé I am working on a game for one of the biggest brands and studios in the world!</li>
<li>üòç The people I work with now are as awesome as the people I used to work with before!</li>
<li>üíØ I work with people in many different roles and backgrounds. I really enjoy this! So many kick ass gameplay engineers, producers, technical artists, vfx artists, writers and the list goes on &hellip;</li>
<li>ü§Ø If somone told me that I would learn as much I have in this one year&hellip; I would not believe it. The amount I technical knowledge I gained in this one year has been mind blowing to me. So many talented people to learn from and get feedback from! So many cool challenges to tackle. I learn something new-almost-every-day!</li>
<li>üòé I am now a lead for one of the coolest components in the project!</li>
<li>üí™ I got promoted to senior gameplay engineer!</li>
<li>ü•∞ I got the title role of &ldquo;Everything Everywhere All At Once&rdquo; in a game jam hosted by Red Storm along with NCSU students (to be honest, I think this is the highlight of the year. I feel very honoured. I love this movie.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="looking-back-at-my-time-at-microsoft">Looking back at my time at Microsoft</h1>
<p>I am really grateful for my time there.<br>
The time I spent there really shaped the growth mindset that I have today.<br>
That is largely due to the amazing managers, peers, leaders, mentors that I had.<br>
Making the decision to leave was the hardest career decision I ever did.</p>
<h1 id="looking-back-at-making-the-transition">Looking back at making the transition</h1>
<p>I knew I had to make a switch and work on making games as a full time job.<br>
It is something I wanted to do since I was 12. Life took me to other paths and I wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing. Still, that was something itching in my mind&hellip;<br>
&hellip; but it was hard to act on it. I was getting paid really well, working with a kickass team on a kickass project.<br>
I was in a very confortable zone.</p>
<p>Being in a confortable zone is also why I wanted to make a change.<br>
I was too confortable and not expanding my skill set into the areas that I deeply wanted to.</p>
<h2 id="mentors">Mentors</h2>
<p>They really helped me ask myself questions that I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about.<br>
Talking to them about it helped me understand the reasons why I wanted to make a change.</p>
<h2 id="hometeamgamedev">HomeTeamGameDev</h2>
<p>The HomeTeamGameDev group helped me solidify that I really enjoyed making games.<br>
This is actually a super fun group. Hopefully my personal life will get into a more stable routine soon and I will be able to join the group again.</p>
<h2 id="gain-confidence-to-even-apply-for-jobs">Gain confidence to even apply for jobs</h2>
<p>The main person to call out was Chris DeLeon (one of the perks of HomeTeamGameDev is that you get to have some mentorship sessions with people that are/were in the game industry) I scheduled one with Chris and he was able (maybe without knowing) give me the confidence to actually apply for a job.<br>
I remember him saying something to the effect that he saw I had the skills and what I needed was to figure out a way of getting my foot in the door.</p>
<h2 id="support-from-my-wife">Support from my wife</h2>
<p>My wife was extremely supportive. Emotionally and financially.<br>
She knows me like no one else and she knew I had to make the switch.<br>
She was also onboard with making any changes in our life to account for the pay cut I would be getting.</p>
<h1 id="looking-back-at-my-first-year-at-ubisofts-red-storm-studio">Looking back at my first year at Ubisoft&rsquo;s Red Storm studio</h1>
<p>This is the part that I revist what I wrote one year ago.</p>
<h2 id="first-few-days-weeks-months">First few days, weeks, months&hellip;</h2>
<p>This period was emotionally tough.</p>
<p>As a recap&hellip;<br>
Prior to joining, I was feeling anxious and insecure:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;How fast can I start making an impact?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Will people judge me if I don&rsquo;t know how to do &lsquo;X&rsquo;?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Am I doing the best decision here?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I joined, I felt overwhelmed:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;wow&hellip; I have never used Jira and Confluence before&hellip; this looks wildly confusing&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;so many custom tools and processes&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;how do I wrap my head around this game&rsquo;s code?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;what are all these acronyms?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do people mean when they say X, Y, Z&hellip; ? it sounds like this word has more meaning that it seems&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>the list goes on&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>As weeks and months went by, I started to understand and to become more familiar with the tools, processes, roles, and structures.<br>
Like I said, the people I work with are amazing!</p>
<p>to be specific, here are the key people/areas that I think were very important to me in that period.</p>
<h3 id="my-onboarding-buddy-nick">My onboarding buddy, Nick</h3>
<p>Nick checked in with me pretty much every day and almost always finished our conversations with a version of &ldquo;anything else on your mind? Anything confusing or that needs clarification?&rdquo;.<br>
That was extremely helpful, I am super grateful for his help.</p>
<h3 id="my-manager-bobby">My manager, Bobby</h3>
<p>Bobby was super helpful in so many different ways. He still is - almost every day.<br>
So when I joined, he made me feel part of the team from day one.<br>
Bobby has, what it seems to me, a very natural way of making people feel included and with connecting with people.
I learned a lot from just observing his communication style.</p>
<p>From a technical stand point,<br>
Bobby helped me - a lot - in ramping up on the various systems in our team, in the project and the structure of the project at a code and organizational level. What I appreciated the most is how he was able to make time to guide me through all that.</p>
<h3 id="my-immediate-team">My immediate team!!</h3>
<p>This is the best team in the project! no bias&hellip;<br>
One of my biggest fears about moving to a whole new company/team was&hellip;<br>
&ldquo;what if I end up working with a bunch of assholes?&rdquo;<br>
My immediate team put those worries away in no time, everyone was so welcoming and friendly! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>I am trying to find words to describe how they went about it&hellip;<br>
&hellip; and as I try to put into words, all I can do is smile from remembering how I felt xD (too emotional?)<br>
So I guess&hellip; it was all the little things? Like daily off topic chats, jokes and so on.</p>
<h3 id="the-it-tech-team-content-management">The IT, Tech team, content management!</h3>
<p>These are &ldquo;the heroes we need&hellip; not the ones we deserve&hellip;&rdquo; <br>
I don&rsquo;t think we thank them enough. They keep project alive in so many ways.
I had little to no downtime during my onboarding, all issues I had were quickly resolved and most of my onboarding was done on day one.  This keeps being true every week.</p>
<h2 id="making-an-impact-and-gaining-confidence--58-months-in">Making an impact and gaining confidence  (5~8 months in?)</h2>
<p>One of the best advice I heard about making an impact on a team was actually really simple&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Be helpful&hellip; Listen to what people are saying and help them.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>In more specific terms,<br>
what are they trying to achieve? what issues are they having? what help are they asking for? what is the issue that keeps getting discussed?<br>
Once you know what these things are, go and help solve it.</p>
<p>Once you have done that for a while and it is your turn to bring up problems that you need help with, people will likely listen to you and maybe even help. (don&rsquo;t count on getting help, but you will likely get help from people you helped before).</p>
<p>So it is clear how that helps in making an impact.<br>
How about gaining confidence?<br>
Solving problems that other people are having, allows you to get gain confidence that you belong in this group because you are solvig problems that they have.</p>
<p>I have used this approach in different settings/situations.<br>
It has worked really well and I will likely continue to use it.</p>
<h2 id="present-time">Present time</h2>
<p>I am now a lead on one the coolest components in our project.<br>
I am super happy and proud to be doing that.</p>
<p>Around the same time, I go promoted to a senior level!</p>
<p>There is a lot non-programming work that comes with it, and a lot of work and people management. This isn&rsquo;t new to me. It is not my favorite type of work, but I do know that I can do it well, so I am more than happy to setup up to the role.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This year has been a blast!<br>
Read that fuck yeah list again!</p>
