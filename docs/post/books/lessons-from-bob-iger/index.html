<p>I heard about Bob Iger after reading an article that mentioned that the CEO of Disney was thinking of running for the president of the USA.<br>
I love Disney, but I never really knew anything about their CEO so I looked him up.</p>
<p>and guess what?<br>
He has done some pretty amazing shit!<br>
I watched a couple of interviews he gave and I really liked the way he talked:</p>
<ul>
<li>very precise</li>
<li>very calm</li>
<li>never rushing
He came across to me as a leader.</li>
</ul>
<p>In one of his recent interviews, he was promoting his new book. This book:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ride of a Lifetime - Lessons learned from 15 years as CEO of Disney</li>
</ul>
<p>Given his achievements, given my love for Disney and the way I perceived him&hellip;<br>
I thought that I could learn something from his book.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-think-i-will-learn-from-this-book">What do I think I will learn from this book?</h1>
<p>I actually had no idea what I would be learning.<br>
However, I knew I would learn something.</p>
<h1 id="thoughts-after-listening-the-prologue">Thoughts after listening the prologue</h1>
<p>The prologue was very interesting and it got me hooked.<br>
He started in a very unusual way.<br>
It didn&rsquo;t really make sense why he was telling some specific stories&hellip;<br>
&hellip; until it clicked.</p>
<p>He starts talking about how he wanted to retire after opening Disney Shangai - that was 11 years of being a CEO.<br>
However, life doesn&rsquo;t always goes as planned.<br>
and then he shifted to telling two stories:</p>
<ul>
<li>A massacre that happened near Disney at a night club : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a></li>
<li>About a child who was killed by an alligator inside Disney&rsquo;s resort. : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t quite make sense why he was telling these stories, but then I realized that he was setting up the scenarios in which showed how compartmentalization and relying on other people is really important.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the prologue he mentions what this book is about.
In his words, &ldquo;this book is about how to nurture the good and deal with the bad&rdquo;</p>
<p>This got me really excited for reading the rest of the book!
This is something I think I do really well.<br>
Yet, I know that there is much to learn on how to nurture the good and deal with the bad.<br>
Bad things happens all the time every where.<br>
One thing that has helped me a lot in life, when bad things happen to you, is that&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>is is not about what happens to you, it is about what you do when it happens.
If you use that framework, you are in control when things go bad.</li>
</ul>
