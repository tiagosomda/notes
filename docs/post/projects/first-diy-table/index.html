<h1 id="why-did-i-build-a-table">Why did I build a table?</h1>
<p>My work desk was bending after about 1 year of working from home.<br>
My office equipment is actually pretty heavy.<br>
So I decided to build a table!</p>
<h1 id="why-not-just-buy-one">Why not just buy one?</h1>
<p>I like building things.<br>
and some youtube videos claimed I could make one for under $100.</p>
<p>and  the biggest reasons were that if I build one:</p>
<ol>
<li>would be fun!</li>
<li>I would learn a new skill!</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="how-did-i-go-about-it">How did I go about it?</h1>
<p>I watched tons and tons of youtube videos to learn the different techniques and styles for building a table.<br>
I mentioned to my buddy Matt that I wanted to build a table and he told me that he had ALL THE TOOLS! for building a table.<br>
He saved me a lof of money on renting/buying the tools üòÅ
(Thanks Matt!)</p>
<p>My plan was to build something like a workbench.
Instead of having a full frame at the bottom, I wanted to space for my chair and legs.<br>
I also love tables that can easily move, so I knew I had to put some casters on it as well üòà<br>
(the casters definitely pushed the cost to over $100)</p>
<h1 id="mistakes">Mistakes!</h1>
<p>I did a couple of rookie mistakes while building the table (as most people do when trying things for the first time).<br>
The biggest mistake was getting the wrong measurements, but I was able to turn those bugs into features of my desk.</p>
<h2 id="bug-to-feature-1">Bug to Feature #1</h2>
<p>The legs were a bit too short, so instead of having the legs go all the way up to the top frame, they are a bit lower, which gave me the right height and it gave a little space where I can hang my headset on.</p>
<h2 id="bug-to-feature-2">Bug to Feature #2</h2>
<p>When I got my plywood, I asked them to cut to the wrong size.<br>
I had the right measurements, but I had this &ldquo;imposter syndrome&rdquo; when I was buying the plywood and I told them the wrong measurement&hellip;<br>
but now! I have a little door at the top of my table which I can pass cables below or easily hook things to the power strip I added on the table üòÅ</p>

<h1 id="am-i-going-to-do-more">Am I going to do more?</h1>
<p>Definitely!<br>
I have plans to build a table for a tv.</p>
<ul>
<li>my plan is to actually undo a table I put together a couple of years ago and make two tables out of it. Use one and sell the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some good youtube channels that explain how to build stuff with simple tools and materials:</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use only them as your resources. There are tons of other videos and blogs where you can learn bits and pieces about what you might want to create.</p>
