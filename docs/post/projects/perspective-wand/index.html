<h1 id="have-you-heard-of-superluminal">Have you heard of Superluminal?</h1>
<p>If not, check it out!<br>
I really enjoyed playing it : <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1049410/Superliminal/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link to Superluminal on Steam</a>
</p>
<p>The puzzles are incredible.<br>
It has this game mechanic that tricks your mind. Even when you understand it, it still leaves you in awe.</p>
<p>If you know me, you know where this is going&hellip;<br>
I wondered how would it feel to interact with this game mechanic in the real world.<br>
I am really into VR and that is probably the only environment (for now) that we could experience this game mechanic.</p>
<p>It also got me thinking&hellip;<br>
Is it even possible to do this in VR?</p>
<p>I did some research and found this gold gem on youtube:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFEIUcXCEvI"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How do non-euclidean games work? | Bitwise</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The video talks about what non-euclidian games are (super freaking cool is what they are).<br>
Fast forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/lFEIUcXCEvI?t=646"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10:46 in the video</a>
 and it explains how the game mechanic in Superluminal works.</p>
<p>I gotta say&hellip;<br>
&hellip; I was a <em><strong>Bit Wiser</strong></em> after watching that video!<br>

<h1 id="how-does-the-game-mechanic-work">How does the game mechanic work?</h1>
<p>The video puts it really well <strong>&ldquo;as you pick up an object, its perspective stays the same, but its real size changes dramatically.&rdquo;</strong><br>
Meaning, something small that you pick up on a table, becomes really big if you point it at some place far away.<br>
There are all sorts of interesting puzzles that you can make with that.</p>
<p>The logic behind this mechanic is super simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you pick up the object, you store
<ul>
<li>the current distance from the player to the object and</li>
<li>also the current scale value of the object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As you move the object in the world, push it as far as you can.</li>
<li>With that object in that position,
<ul>
<li>get that distance and initial distance stored.</li>
<li>this gives you a ratio that you can use to calculate the scale that the object should have in this new distance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My mind was blown. ü§Ø<br>
It makes so much sense AND it is so clever.</p>
<h1 id="how-did-i-go-about-building-this-in-vr">How did I go about building this in VR?</h1>
<p>I am familiar with making VR things in Unity, so that was an easy choice for me.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to</p>
<ul>
<li>first make the mechanic work in a regular 2D screen</li>
<li>and then tackle how it work work in VR</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure there would be more to it then the simple math.<br>
It turns out that the hardest part, to me, was figuring out where to place the object.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways I tried doing that&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="attempt-1-push-the-object-backwards-a-little-bit-every-frame">Attempt #1: Push the object backwards a little bit every frame</h2>
<p>That initially worked well.<br>
However, but once my object was far away and I looked at something that was close, when my object was already passed it.</p>
<p>I added a Raycast to check if whatever I was pointing at was closer to where the object currently was.<br>
That didn&rsquo;t solve the problem entirely. The Raycast is a very thin line so the object I was holding would stay behind another object until I actually aimed into an object that was closer.</p>
<p>So I tried something else.</p>
<h2 id="attempt-2-at-every-frame-calculate-farthest-position-starting-from-the-closest-position">Attempt #2: At every frame, calculate farthest position starting from the closest position</h2>
<p>This actually worked out very well.<br>
There are probably other solutions that are more efficient.<br>
I actually spent a couple of hours over the weekend trying different ways, but I took a little break and remembered what my goal was:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> to experience this in VR.</li>
<li><strong>Not A Goal:</strong> to make the most efficient mechanic in the world.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="calculating-the-farthest-the-object-can-be">Calculating the farthest the object can be</h2>
<p>This is actually an interesting problem.</p>
<p>How do we know we can place an object at a certain position?
Unity does not give us a way to do a collision check on demand given a collider (if it does, let me know!).</p>
<p>So to do that check, I used <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.CheckBox.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&ldquo;Unity&rsquo;s Physics Check Box collision&rdquo;</a>
<br>
To define the box size, I used an approximation.
I scaled the box size to what the object&rsquo;s scale would be at a certain point.<br>
It is not perfect, but it works with most shapes.</p>
<h3 id="how-else-could-we-do-this">How else could we do this?</h3>
<p>There are many other ways.<br>
I think one of the best solutions would be for each object to have a component that calculates how far it can be pushed back given an initial position and direction.</p>
<p>In that way, simple objects can use something like I mentioned above. Complex objects can implement something that checks for collisions using different shapes and sizes. (for example, an object with holes in it, like a donut.)</p>
<p>The mathematician in me also likes the other possibility to figure out a set of boxes which can fill an object&rsquo;s space.<br>
That could be using in some preprocessing function or in realtime.<br>
During the &ldquo;push back operation&rdquo;, we check if any of the boxes are collisind with anything else.</p>
<p>Again, this was a weekend project. So I brought myself to focus on the task.<br>
(As I write this, I have this itch to go back and give these other options a try&hellip;)</p>
<h1 id="experiencing-it-in-vr">Experiencing it in VR</h1>
<p>So there are a few things to think about.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we pick up an object?</li>
<li>Which direction do we push it away?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-pick-up-the-object">How to pick up the object?</h2>
<p>There were two ways I thought about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick up the object by grabbing it.</li>
<li>Use a pointer (or some cool &ldquo;perspective wand&rdquo;) to point to select an object.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grabing the object would be really cool, because it would give you the extra idea that &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be placing this really far away, it is right here in my hands&rdquo;.<br>
However, I would have to change how the mechanic work to actually just place the object far away, when I actually let go of the object, which meant changing my current implementation. So I decided to maybe try that later. (I haven&rsquo;t yet)</p>
<p>So I went with option two. Simple click pointer.</p>
<h2 id="which-direction-do-we-push-it-away">Which direction do we push it away?</h2>
<p>We want the object to scale in relation to the position of our eyes,
but we want to use our hands to place the object in different locations.</p>
<p>So then, the direction to push the object becomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>from: the middle point in between the player&rsquo;s eyes</li>
<li>to: the location where the hand is pointing to (raycast from the hand&rsquo;s/wand&rsquo;s forward position to whatever we hit)</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is very similar to the 2D screen effect.<br>
Except that in that frame of view, we are always pointing at the center of the camera and the camera is always moving to where we are pointing.</p>
<p>and that is it!<br>
It does work in VR!</p>
<h1 id="how-did-it-feel-to-use-this-perspective-wand-in-vr">How did it feel to use this &ldquo;perspective wand&rdquo; in VR?</h1>
<p>It feels like doing magic!
I threw together a bunch of assets in a scene and went crazy with moving them around.<br>
I tricked myself many times.<br>
I sometimes still get tricked when I place something in the sky without realizing.<br>
When that happens, the object starts to fall very slowing and that is what makes me realize that the object is really far away and also veeery large.</p>
<h1 id="where-can-i-try-it">Where can I try it?</h1>
<p>I am hosting a WebGL (non-vr) version that you can give a try here:</p>
