    <h1 class="article title">What is my motto? this up here ^ </h1><p class="article date">Feb 12, 2021</p></section><article class="article markdown-body"><p>As I was taking a class in called &ldquo;How To Make Great Decisions&rdquo; at the Seattle community college (thanks Microsoft for sponsoring it!),<br>
I had to keep a daily journal. One of the questions I had to answer in one of these days was &ldquo;What is your motto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I thought about it, my mind went straight into a message that I used to have on my way out of my room.<br>
That message was &ldquo;The Staying Speed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This was something I came up with a long time ago when I used to practice kung fu. I read a lot about Jeet Kune Do and other quotes and teachings from Bruce Lee. I think I got that idea from those, but I could never find it mentioned anywhere. So if you have heard of this again, let me know!</p>
<p><strong>To me, the meaning behind &ldquo;The Staying Speed&rdquo; is</strong>&hellip;<br>
&hellip;about finding the right amount of time and effort needed to reach a goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put too little effort and time (how often you do something) and you won&rsquo;t accomplish it.</li>
<li>Put too much effort and time and you might get burned out, bored, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The Staying Speed&rdquo; is</strong> &hellip;<br>
the right balance of the amount of effort and time you put into a goal.<br>
The speed is not always the same. It depends not only on what you are working on, but also your emotional state as well.
Knowing that, allows you to recognize when it is too little and when it is too much and adjust so you can accomplish your goals.</p>
